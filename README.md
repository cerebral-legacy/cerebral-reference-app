# cerebral-reference-app
A reference application for Cerebral

### Before you dive in...
[An introduction video can be seen here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhttyHQ8q_M). Keep it mind that this is a startup codebase. A lot of changes has been made a long the way, which usually suggests a complete mess. With Cerebrals separation of application logic and views we have been able to change things around with great speed and still keep a clean codebase. Of course there are still things to refactor, this is not a "clean up version" of the code. This is our frontend codebase February 17. 2016.
