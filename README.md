# cerebral-reference-app
A reference application for Cerebral

### Before you dive in...
[An introduction video can be seen here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhttyHQ8q_M). Keep it mind that this is a startup codebase. A lot of changes has been made a long the way, which usually suggests a complete mess. With Cerebrals separation of application logic and UI we have been able to change things around with great speed and still keep a clean codebase. Of course there are still things to refactor, but this is not a "clean up version" of the code. This is just our frontend codebase February 17. 2016, wrapping up phase 1 of our startup.
